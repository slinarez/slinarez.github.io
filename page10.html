<p style="color:white; text-align:center;"> We used to be so close, but things change. You've changed I've changed. Who's to say we've changed in good ways or bad. Regardless of all that we always find ourselves here.. over and over again.</p> 

<img src="image10.jpg" style="width:700px; height:500px;">

<p style="color:red; text-align:center;">In time you'll forget about me, but I'll always be here whether you like it or not... I'll always be waiting for you, for the day you truly are ready to accept me.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><a href="index.html" style="color:red;">Until then it's goodbye yet again.</a></p>
