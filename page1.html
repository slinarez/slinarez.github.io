<h1 style="text-align:center;">Glitch</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">For this assignment I had to glitch three images of my choosing. In order to glitch them I glitched one by taking the code of it and adding more code lines to it and the other by uploading the image into an audio program and adding an effect to it. Both were then uploaded to photoshop to see what the results were and finalize them.</p>
